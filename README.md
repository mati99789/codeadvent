# 🎄 Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges implemented in three different programming languages:

- 🚀 JavaScript (Pro level: Can code in my sleep!)
- 🏃 Go (Mid-level: Still occasionally Googling syntax)
- 🐍 Python (Level: Help! Where are my curly braces?)

## 📁 Project Structure

    └── dayXX/
        ├── solution.py   # Contains lots of print("what am I doing?")
        └── input.txt
```

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. 💪 Flex my JavaScript muscles
2. 🌱 Grow my Go knowledge from "meh" to "yeah!"
3. 🐣 Learn Python from scratch (and try not to cry)
4. 🔄 Compare different approaches and syntax across languages
5. 📝 Document my journey from "print('Hello World')" to actual Python code

## 🚀 Running Solutions

### JavaScript (The Comfort Zone)
```bash
cd javascript/dayXX   # Watch the magic unfold
```

### Go (The Growing Zone)
```bash
cd golang/dayXX
go run main.go      # Cross fingers, probably works
```

### Python (The Danger Zone)
```bash
cd python/dayXX
python solution.py  # What could possibly go wrong?
```

## 📚 Learning Strategy

For each challenge:
1. 🏃‍♂️ First solve in JavaScript (because comfort zone is comfortable)
2. 🤔 Implement in Go (with occasional Stack Overflow visits)
3. 🐍 Convert to Python while:
   - Googling "how to loop in Python"
   - Understanding why indentation matters so much
   - Missing semicolons and curly braces
   - Discovering that Python is actually pretty cool!

## ✅ Progress Tracking

- [ ] Day 1: JavaScript ✅ | Go 🏃 | Python 😅
- [ ] Day 2: JavaScript ✅ | Go 🤔 | Python 🆘
- [ ] Day 3: Coming soon...

## 🐍 Python Learning Resources

As I'm new to Python (very new, like "which end of the snake is the head" new), these are my lifelines:
- 📚 Python Official Documentation (my new bedtime reading)
- 🎓 Real Python (real helpful for a real beginner)
- 🧘‍♂️ Python Koans (for achieving Python enlightenment)
- 💬 Python Discord Community (where I ask my "why doesn't this work" questions)

## 📝 Notes

Each solution directory includes:
- 📄 Solution file in the respective language
- 📊 Input data file
- 📌 Additional notes or explanations when needed (mostly in Python, explaining what I learned)

Remember: JavaScript is my sword ⚔️, Go is my shield 🛡️, and Python is my... well, I'm still figuring out what Python is! 🐍

## Daily Mantras

- JavaScript: "I got this!" 💪
- Go: "I think I got this..." 🤔
- Python: "What is this?" 😅
